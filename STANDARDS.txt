Code standards:
	- camelCase
	- class names begin with Uppercase
	- spacing:
		- tabs - 4 spaces, tabs only
		- { are on the same line with the last piece of code (Java style)
		- exactly one single space before { => if (true){ is WRONG, if (true) { is CORRECT
		- exactly one space before conditions; if(true) WRONG, while (true) CORRECT
		- exactly one space before and after operators; if (a==b) WRONG, if (a == b) CORRECT
		- always use {}, even if there is a single instruction
			if (a == b)
				return true;    //WRONG
			
			if (a == b) {
				return true;    //CORRECT
			}
		- exactly one empty line between functions from the same class 
			int f() {
				//blabla
			}					//WRONG
			int g() {
				//blabla
			}	

			int f() {
				//blabla
			}
								//CORRECT
			int g() {
				//blabla
			}
			
		- variables and class names should be suggestive

		
Git standars:
	- always create and work on another branches, not on master
	- branches should have a specific name
	- one commit/modification => there should not be modifications on more than one feature in one commit
	- always write a short description of the commit 
	- description format: 
		Commit title
		Commit message
		<blank line>
		Signature
	- always sign the commit with your name and email (CTRL + S shortcut in git gui)
	- make a pull request to master only when all modifications for the branch specific feature are made and you are sure they are what you want to be
	- pull requests are accepted only after someone else has reviewed the pull request
